# Car-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression-Model
This project uses a linear regression model to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, make, model, engine size, fuel type, etc. The model is trained using a dataset of historical car sales and evaluates how factors influence the price.
# Dataset
The dataset consists of several columns that describe the attributes of used cars: 
Car Make and Model: The brand and specific model of the car (e.g., Toyota Camry, Honda Accord).
Year of Manufacture: The year the car was manufactured.
Mileage: Total number of miles driven.
Engine Size: The engine displacement (in liters).
Fuel Type: Whether the car runs on petrol, diesel, or other types of fuel.
Transmission: Whether the car has manual or automatic transmission.
Previous Owners: The number of previous owners the car has had.
Price: The selling price of the car (target variable).

The performnce of model is based on the Mean Square Error and R2 Score
